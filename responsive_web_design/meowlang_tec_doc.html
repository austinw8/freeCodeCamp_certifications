      <p>MeowLang is a playful, whimsical programming language inspired by the unpredictable nature of cats.</p>
      <p>With MeowLang, code is written using feline-inspired syntax that mimics the mysterious and capricious behavior of cats. It’s designed to be fun and a bit chaotic, just like living with a cat, while still being functional for basic programming tasks.</p>
      <p>This tec-doc will cover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cat variables</li>
        <li>Whisker functions</li>
        <li>Pounce operators</li>
        <li>Cat loops</li>
        <li>Cat conditionals</li>
      </ul>
      </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="cat_variables">
      <header>Cat Variables</header>
      <p>In MeowLang, variables are declared by "feeding" them a value. Much like a cat, they can wander off and change their value at will, so don't be surprised when they decide to change unexpectedly.</p>
      <p>The "feed" keyword is used to assign values, and you can "purr" to print out the current value.</p>
    <code>
      feed food = "Fish" <br> purr food
    </code>
      </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="whisker_functions">
      <header>Whisker Functions</header>
      <p>Functions in MeowLang are called "whiskers," symbolizing the delicate balance between curiosity and chaos.</p>
      <p>Functions can return a value, but expect them to occasionally misbehave, much like how a cat might choose to ignore you when you need them most.</p>
    <code>
      whisker greet(name) {<br>
      feed greeting = "Hello, " + name<br>
      purr greeting<br>
      }<br>
whisker greet("Fluffy")    
</code>
      </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="pounce_operator">
      <header>Pounce Operator</header>
      <p>Pouncing is a core concept in MeowLang, where one action triggers another—much like how a cat pounces on an unsuspecting object.</p>
      <p>The "pounce" operator allows you to perform chained actions, with each pounce producing a consequence. Think of it as combining functions in a single line.</p>
      <code>
        pounce feed toy = "Ball" purr toy
      </code>
      </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="cat_loops">
      <header>Cat Loops</header>
      <p>Cats love to chase, and in MeowLang, loops simulate that endless pursuit.</p>
      <p>The "chase" keyword creates a loop that will continue running until a certain condition is met. Just like a cat chasing something, it may never stop unless you intervene.</p>
      <code>
        chase feed counter = 0 until counter > 5 {<br>
  feed counter = counter + 1<br>
  purr counter<br>
}
</code>
      </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="cat_conditionals">
      <header>Cat Conditionals</header>
      <p>MeowLang has conditionals that act like a cat's judgment call—purring when something is good and swatting when it's bad.</p>
      <p>The "swat" keyword is used for an else statement, while the "purr" keyword is used when conditions are met. Cats are notoriously selective, so be prepared for unexpected results.</p>
      <code>
        feed mood = "Hungry"<br>
if mood == "Hungry" {<br>
  purr "Feed me, human!"<br>
} swat {<br>
  purr "I'll ignore you now."<br>
}
      </code>
      </section>
